description: We provided a long-term electrophysiological dataset of 10 pilocarpine-treated
  temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) rats during the development of epilepsy. The dataset
  was constituted by multi-site local field potential (LFP) signal recorded from 12
  sites in the circuit of Papez in TLE, including all spontaneous seizure fragments
  in the chronic period. The LFP data were saved in MATLAB and stored as the Neurodata
  Without Borders (NWB) standard. The dataset can be used to evaluate the variations
  of the latency of seizure onsets, seizure onset zone (SOZ), seizure onset pattern
  (SOP), and functional network connectivity during the development of epilepsy. We
  have technically validated the dataset and analyzed the spectral power of LFP data.
  This dataset is available to reveal how electrophysiological and epileptic network
  properties of chronic TLE rats change from early to late stages, and help inform
  the design of adaptive neuromodulation for epilepsy.
